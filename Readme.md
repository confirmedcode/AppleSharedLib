# Apple Shared libraries

Confirmed VPN is the first VPN to be completely Openly Operated. All of our code is open source, and we prove that our code is the only code on our server, which follow these principles:

* **Disabling SSH or direct machine access
* **No database password or other secrets access
* **Not allowing users to assume roles intended for machines
* **Not allowing any remote sessions
* **Disabling flow logs
* **Not allowing any custom commands on machines


## Shared Code
These three classes are shared code between the macOS & iOS client. If you have any questions, concerns, or other feedback, please let us know any feedback in Github issues or by e-mail.

We also have a bug bounty program that can be found here: https://hackerone.com/confirmed_inc
